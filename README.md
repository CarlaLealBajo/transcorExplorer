# TransCOR Explorer

## Overview

TransCOR Explorer is a web-based visualization tool designed to empower clinicians by simplifying the exploration of complex clinical datasets, including the outputs generated by dimensionality reduction algorithms. It provides an intuitive platform for visualizing and interacting with clinical variables and biosignals, making it easier for non-technical users to engage with artificial intelligence (AI)-generated insights without requiring data science expertise.

This tool is particularly valuable for exploring datasets in healthcare contexts, including genetic, ECG, and ultrasound data, enabling users to filter, compare, and visualize data with ease.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run TransCOR Explorer, you need to have the following installed:

- Node.js (>= v12.x.x)
- npm (>= v6.x.x) or yarn

### Installation
Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/transcor-explorer.git`

Install dependencies:

`cd transcor-explorer`

`npm install`

Start the application:

`npm start`

Open the browser at http://localhost:3000 to use the tool.

### Data Upload: JSON structure
Upload patient data in a .json format via the interface.

- Dataframe: A list of objects, each representing a patient's data.
- availableDimensions: A list of the dimensions available for visualization.
- availableTemporalFeatures: A list of temporal features present in the dataset.
- availableInputClinicalVar: A list of input clinical variables.
- availableOutputClinicalVar: A list of output clinical variables.
- availableGroupByVar: A list of variables available for grouping.
- availablePatients: A list of patient IDs.
- (optional) toolTip: Variables to be shown as tooltips in the plots.
- (optional) datasetDescription: A description of the dataset for the general overview tab.
- (optional) legend: A mapping of real meanings for categorical variables.

## Visualization Modes
- Overview Mode: View grouped clinical variables and highlight statistically significant ones.
- Single View Mode: Explore individual patient data for detailed clinical analysis.
- Temporal Features: Visualize biosignals and temporal data with superimposed displays or population averages.
- Output Space: Compare dimensions from AI-reduced spaces using scatter plots and kernel density estimation (KDE).
## Supported Algorithms
The tool supports various dimensionality reduction techniques, including:
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- ISOMAP
- Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL)
- Laplacian Eigenmaps
- Autoencoders

## Statistical Features
- Chi-square Test for binary variable association
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test for normality
- ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables based on normality results
- Density Plot Generation to visualize data distributions and outcome likelihoods
- Technical Stack
- Front-End: Built using the React JavaScript library.
- Visualization: Uses Vega-Lite for generating responsive, interactive plots.
- Data Handling: Data is processed on the client-side, ensuring user privacy by avoiding server-side data transfer.
